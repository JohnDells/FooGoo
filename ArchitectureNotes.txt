Controllers
	Purpose:	Provide an REST/HTTP interface to the FooManager.
	Goal:		Should be as lightweight as possible, with no logic whatsoever.

Managers
	Purpose:	To provide orchestration and business logic.
					These tend towards the facade pattern for simple CRUD operations.

Repositories:
	Purpose:	To provide an interface to data stores.
	Goal:		Should be able to be swapped out without impace to the application.
	Interface:  Should have nothing specific to any implementation.

Data Structure:
	Foo:		This is the root "thing".
	FooType:	This is a lookup parent to Foo and is intended to have a limited number of values.
	Bar:		This is a child of "Foo", with a one to many relationship to it's parent.
					Usually nothing is ever done to these records outside the context of it's parent foo.
	Baz:		This is a sibling of "Foo", with a many to many relationship.
	Goo:		This is a relationship between two Foos "nodes" - representing the "edge" in a graph implementation.
